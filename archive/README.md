## Why Archive These Files?

These documents capture the project's evolution but are no longer accurate references for:
- Current architecture (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md))
- Release process (see [RELEASING.md](../docs/RELEASING.md))
- Setup instructions (see [GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md))

They are kept to:
- Preserve project history
- Show decision-making evolution
- Reference for "lessons learned"
